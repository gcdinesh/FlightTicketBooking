# FlightTicketBooking
FlightTicketBooking.java class has the main code. Run it and you will get the details printed in your console.

Complexities:
* For a given input generates the flight seats with types as a ArrayList<LinkedList<SeatDetail>. -> This takes O(numberOfSeats)
* For the given flight seats assigns the passenger in O(numberOfPassengers)
* Because of the above data structure the space complexity is O(numberOfSeats)


Enhancement:
Should align the output as per the flight position
